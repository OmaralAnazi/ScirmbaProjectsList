# Scirmba Projects List
The [Scrimba Front-end Program](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) is structured into multiple modules, each containing several projects. This repository is organized in the same manner, mirroring the sequence in which the projects were completed.

In each folder, you'll find the source code for the respective project, along with as well as a README file detailing its outcomes and learning objectives.

Please note that the Scrimba Front-end Program is continuously updated, so the course content may differ from what Omar Alanazi experienced during his time in the program. Nevertheless, you can find an outline of the modules as they were during his enrollment included here.
